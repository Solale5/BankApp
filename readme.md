# Banking App

This is an online banking system designed for customers to easily manage their finances from anywhere at any time.

## Technologies Used

## Project Description

The Banking App is an application that allows customers to access their banking information and perform various tasks such as viewing their account balances, transferring funds between accounts, paying bills, and managing their personal information. The application is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

## Required Technologies (for developers)

To run the Banking App, you will need the following technologies installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MySQL

Node.js is required to run the application, as it is built using the React framework and uses Node.js as its runtime environment. MySQL is used as the database management system for the application, storing customer information and transaction history.

Before running the application, ensure that Node.js and MySQL are properly installed and configured on your machine. You may also need to set up a MySQL database and configure the application to connect to it. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found in the application documentation or README file.
